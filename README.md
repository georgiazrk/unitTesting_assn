This is my unit testing assignment for the Principles of Software Testing paper in my Bachelors degree. We were tasked with writing at least 20 testing methods to ensure the correctness of the code we were provided with and to have 100% statement coverage. We were given the code for a doubly linked list and a method to find prime numbers and performed testing on these. This assignment was done using C# in Visual Studio 2022.
